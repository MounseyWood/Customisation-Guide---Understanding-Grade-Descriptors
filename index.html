            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This guide provides step-by-step instructions for customising the "Understanding Grade Descriptors" interactive tool for your specific programme or module. The tool helps students understand the criteria used for grading their work and provides guidance on how to improve their performance.</p>
            
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This guide assumes basic familiarity with HTML files but does not require advanced coding skills. All customisations can be done using simple text editing.</p>

            <h3>1.1 Purpose of the Tool</h3>
            <p>The Understanding Grade Descriptors tool serves several key purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps students understand the specific criteria used for assessment</li>
                <li>Provides visual presentation of grade bands with colour-coding</li>
                <li>Offers targeted advice on how to improve and move up to higher grade bands</li>
                <li>Aligns with the School of Design Curriculum Framework</li>
                <li>Creates a common understanding of standards between staff and students</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>1.2 Tool Components</h3>
            <p>The tool consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An interactive grade band selector with colour-coded buttons</li>
                <li>Detailed description of assessment criteria for each grade band</li>
                <li>Specific advice on how to improve performance</li>
                <li>A comprehensive grading matrix showing all grade bands at once</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Getting Started</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Required Files</h3>
            <p>To customise the tool, you'll need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>KSA_Talk_Understanding_Grade_Descriptors.html</code> file</li>
                <li>A suitable header image for your programme (optional)</li>
                <li>A text editor (e.g., Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or even basic Notepad)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2.2 Downloading the Template</h3>
            <p>You can obtain the HTML template file from:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/MounseyWood/Understanding-Grade-Descriptors-v4">https://github.com/MounseyWood/Understanding-Grade-Descriptors-v4</a></li>
                <li>Your faculty's shared resources folder</li>
                <li>By contacting your Canvas Administrator, Associate Professor David Lawrence <a href="mailto:d.lawrence@kingston.ac.uk">d.lawrence@kingston.ac.uk</a></li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>2.3 Opening the File</h3>
            <p>Open the HTML file in a text editor. Look for the following key sections that you'll need to modify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Header section with title and introduction</li>
                <li>Grade bands data structure</li>
                <li>Assessment criteria for each grade band</li>
                <li>Improvement advice for each grade band</li>
                <li>Complete grading matrix content</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2.4 Code Annotation for Easy Customisation</h3>
            <p>The HTML file includes helpful annotations throughout the code to help non-technical faculty find the right areas to modify. Here's an example of annotated code:</p>

            <h3>3.2 Grade Bands Data Structure</h3>
            <p>The grade bands are defined in the JavaScript code. Look for the <code>grades</code> array in the script section:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
<pre><code>const grades = [

    qualities: [
      // Assessment criteria for this grade
      { title: 'Research & Analysis', description: 'Your tutors are looking for...' },
      // More criteria...
    ]
  },
  // More grade bands...
];</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>Each grade band has the following properties that you may need to modify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>id</code>: A unique identifier (don't change unless necessary)</li>
                <li><code>title</code>: The name of the grade band (e.g., "Distinction", "First Class")</li>
                <li><code>range</code>: The percentage range (e.g., "85% and above")</li>
                <li><code>color</code>: The background colour for this grade band</li>
                <li><code>textColor</code>: The text colour for this grade band</li>
                <li><code>qualities</code>: An array of assessment criteria objects</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note on Colours:</strong> The default colours use a traffic light system from green (highest grades) through amber to red (lowest grades). You may wish to keep this intuitive colour scheme or adapt it to your department's branding.</p>

            <h2>4. Customising Learning Outcomes and Assessment Criteria</h2>
            
            <p>Each grade band contains assessment criteria organised into four categories aligned with the School of Design Curriculum Framework. You'll need to customise these descriptions to match your programme's specific learning outcomes and assessment requirements.</p>
            
            <h3>4.1 Assessment Criteria Structure</h3>
            <p>The criteria are stored in the <code>qualities</code> array for each grade band:</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>4.2 Customising the Criteria Categories</h3>
            <p>If your programme uses different assessment criteria categories than the default four (Research & Analysis, Experimentation & Practice, Communication & Presentation, Personal & Professional Development), you can change the titles and descriptions to match your programme's framework.</p>
            
            <div class="warning">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you change the number of criteria categories, you'll need to make corresponding changes throughout the file, including in the comprehensive grading matrix section.</p>

            <h2>7. Colour Scheme Customisation</h2>
            
            <p>You may wish to customise the colours used for each grade band to match your departmental branding or to make them more accessible.</p>
            
            <h3>7.1 Colour Properties</h3>
            <p>For each grade band in the <code>grades</code> array, you can modify the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>color</code>: The background colour (e.g., <code>bg-[#80FF80]</code>)</li>
                <li><code>textColor</code>: The text colour (e.g., <code>text-black</code>)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>7.2 Grade Band Colour System</h3>
            <p>The tool uses a 'traffic-light' colour system to denote grade bands, from high (green) through amber to low (red). Here are the hex codes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Distinction (85% and above): <code>#80FF80</code> (bright green)</li>
                <li>First Class (70-84%): <code>#BFFF80</code> (light green)</li>
                <li>Upper Second (60-69%): <code>#FFFF80</code> (yellow)</li>
                <li>Lower Second (50-59%): <code>#FFE880</code> (light amber)</li>
                <li>Third Class (40-49%): <code>#FFCC80</code> (amber)</li>
                <li>Marginal Fail (35-39%): <code>#FF9980</code> (light red)</li>
                <li>Fail (0-34%): <code>#FF8080</code> (red)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>7.3 Kingston University Brand Colours</h3>
            <p>If you wish to use the official Kingston University brand colours, here are the hex codes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>KSA Yellow: <code>#FFF200</code></li>
                <li>KU Logo White: <code>#FFFFFF</code></li>

            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When selecting colours, ensure there is sufficient contrast between the background and text colours for accessibility.

            <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>By customising the Understanding Grade Descriptors tool for your programme, you can provide your students with a clear, interactive guide to assessment criteria that helps them understand what is expected at each grade level and how they can improve their performance.</p>
            
            <p>Remember that the tool should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your programme's assessment criteria and pedagogical approach.</p>
            
            <p>We hope this guide has been helpful. If you have suggestions for improving either the tool or this guide, please contact your Canvas Administrator, Associate Professor David Lawrence <a href="mailto:d.lawrence@kingston.ac.uk">d.lawrence@kingston.ac.uk</a>.</p>
